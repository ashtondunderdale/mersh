Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashtondunderdale/mersh.git
cd mersh
```

---

<br>



Use `make` to build the tool. This generates a compiled executable.
```
make
```

<br>

Provide the path of your mermaid script to the executable.
```
./mersh.exe <path_to_mermaid_script.txt>
```

<br>

It will output the generated classes in the `./out` directory.
